Disclaimers:
1- Our program could have graphic issues when you launch it on a very high screen. It is because of swing which doesn't let Windows handle the size of the app. You may need to use a secondary screen to enjoy a full experience of our program.
2- The connexion between the database and the Java program seem to not work on Mac OS. We don't know about other UNIX system.
