<h1>How to install Lorann :</h1>
<ol>
<li>Create a database named 'lorann'<br /><br />
<li>Import the SQL script named lorann in this database<br /><br />
<li>Import the Maven Project on Eclipse.<br /><br />
<li>Select the main.java file and run as java application in Eclipse (in the folder src/main/java in the package explorer)<br /><br />
<li>After doing that, you just have to select a level and play (Be careful, the program won't work if the database is not running)<br /><br />
</ol>

<h1>Files available in the deliverable folder:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Lorann.sql &rarr It's the sql code to generate the database<br /><br />
<li>Project report.pdf &rarr; It's our main deliverable. It countain our bilan, our planning for the project and explaination about the project<br /><br />
<li>lorannTeam.vpp &rarr; It is all of our UML in Visual Paradigm format. You can also find a pdf version of it.<br /><br />
<li>Manual.docx &rarr; It is a documentation about our programm. There are explanation inside to explain the controls.<br /><br />
<li>A folder which countain screen of our tests because they run when we launch them in Eclipse but they alway failed when we try to generate a surefire report<br /><br />
<li>The SureFire report, JavaDoc and the jxr report are in the folder target in the project. You just have to lauch index.html to access to all of them.<br /><br />
</ul>

<h1>Work with:</h1>
<ul>
<li>JDK 8<br /><br />
<li>Eclipse Oxygen<br /><br />
<li>MySQL 5.7.19<br /><br />
<li>Windows 10<br /><br />
</ul>

<h1>Disclaimers:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Our program could have graphic issues when you launch it on a very high screen. It is because of swing which doesn't let Windows handle the size of the app. You may need to use a secondary screen to enjoy a full experience of our program.<br /><br />
<li>The connexion between the database and the Java program seem to not work on Mac OS. We don't know about other UNIX system.<br /><br />
